 <h2>Diode</h2>
 <p>Now that both n -and p -type materials are available, we can construct our first solid-state electronic device: The semiconductor diode , with applications too numerous to mention, is created by simply joining an n -type and a p -type material together, nothing more, just the joining of one material with a majority carrier of electrons to one with a majority carrier of holes. The basic simplicity of its construction simply reinforces the importance of the development of this solid-state era.

   <h4>In this example there are two LEDs that can be used as a polarity detector. Apply a positive source voltage and a green light results. Negative supplies result in a red light. Packages of such combinations are commercially available.  Find the resistor  R  to ensure a current of 20 mA through the “on” diode for the configuration of  Fig.   2.30   . Both diodes have a reverse breakdown voltage of 3 V and an average turn-on voltage of 2 V. </h4>

  <p> <bold> Solution: </bold>  The application of a positive supply voltage results in a conventional current that matches the arrow of the green diode and turns it on.  The polarity of the voltage across the green diode is such that it reverse biases the red diode by the same amount. The result is the equivalent network of  Fig.   2.31   .  Applying Ohm’s law, we obtain </p>

  <p> Note that the reverse breakdown voltage across the red diode is 2 V, which is fine for an LED with a reverse breakdown voltage of 3 V. <br /> However, if the green diode were to be replaced by a blue diode, problems would develop, as shown in  Fig.   2.32   . Recall that the forward bias required to turn on a blue diode is about 5 V. The result would appear to require a smaller resistor  R  to establish the current of 20 mA. However, note that the reverse bias voltage of the red LED is 5 V, but the reverse breakdown voltage of the diode is only 3 V. The result is the voltage across the red LED would lock in at 3 V as shown in  Fig.   2.33   . The voltage across  R  would be 5 V and the current limited to 20 mA with a 250 &#x2126; resistor but neither LED would be on. </p>
   <img src="img/diode (13).png"  alt="" />
    <p> A  simple solution to the above is to add the appropriate resistance level in series with each diode to establish the desired 20 mA and to include another diode to add to the reverse-bias total reverse breakdown voltage rating, as shown in  Fig.   2.34   . When the blue LED is on, the diode in series with the blue LED will also be on, causing a total voltage drop of 5.7 V across the two series diodes and a voltage of 2.3 V across the resistor  R<sub>1</sub> , establishing a high emission current of 19.17 mA. At the same time the red LED diode and its series diode will also be reverse biased, but now the standard diode with a reverse breakdown voltage of 20 V will prevent the full reverse-bias voltage of 8 V from appearing across the red LED. When forward biased, the resistor  R<sub>2</sub>  will establish a current of 19.63 mA to ensure a high level of intensity for the red LED.   </p>
